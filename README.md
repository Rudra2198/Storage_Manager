The objective of this assignment is to develop a storage manager, which is a module that can read blocks from a file on disk into memory and write blocks from memory back to the disk. The storage manager operates on pages (blocks) of a fixed size (PAGE_SIZE). Functions have been provided to create, open, and close files, as well as to read, write, and append pages within a file. The read functions also support reading the current block, the next block, the previous block, and more.
